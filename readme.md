### hi it's me, kraxie :3

basically everything i develop gets uploaded here, so expect a lot of weird stuff that doesn't make much sense. my current main project is [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt), a lightweight and fast spotify client. it's a work-in-progress, but it's quite usable. check it out if you want to, or not, i'm not your mom.
