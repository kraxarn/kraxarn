### Hi :3

I'm kraxie, or Emma, a professional software engineer, computer engineer and game developer.

Basically everything i develop is open source. My current main project is [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt), a lightweight and fast Spotify client. It's a work-in-progress, but it's quite usable. Check it out if you want to, or not, I'm not your mom.

My names, kraxarn and kraxie, are both spelled in all lower-case.

##### My current main languages in order of usage, both open-source and closed-source
* C++: Desktop applications and games.
* C#: Web backend.
* JavaScript: Web frontend.
* Go: Web backend.
* Rust: Games.
