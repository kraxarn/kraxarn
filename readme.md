### Hi :3

I'm kraxie, a professional software engineer, computer engineer and game developer.

Basically everything i develop is open source, so expect a lot of stuff that doesn't make much sense. My current main project is [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt), a lightweight and fast Spotify client. It's a work-in-progress, but it's quite usable. Check it out if you want to, or not, I'm not your mom.

My names, kraxarn and kraxie, are both spelled in all lower-case.

I don't accept donations. If you want to donate, donate to some other organisation or something that actually needs the money. I have enough money to continue working on my side projects for the time being.
