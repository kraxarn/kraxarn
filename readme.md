### Hi :bird:

I'm kraxie, a professional software engineer, embedded systems engineer, computer engineer and game developer.

My current main project is [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt), a lightweight and fast Spotify client. It's a work-in-progress, but it's quite usable. Check it out if you want to, or not, I'm not your mom.

I currently primarily write code in C++ in my free time, as well as C# and TypeScript professionally.

My names, kraxarn and kraxie, are both spelled in all lower-case.
